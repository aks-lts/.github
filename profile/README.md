**The kubernetes-lts GitHub org is a work in progress, and we welcome feedback and contributions. We would like to revive the [Kubernetes WG-LTS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/archive/wg-lts) to collaborate across the ecosystem to collect requirements and define processes and tooling required for creating secure and stable long term support releases of Kubernetes in the future.**
# Repositories

## [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-lts/kubernetes)

This Kubernetes fork is intended to provide long term support (LTS) for Kubernetes releases, but it is not an official release of the Kubernetes project. It is to be used for the application of patches for supported Kubernetes releases with the LTS designation.


## [Community](https://github.com/kubernetes-lts/community)

Community information for the LTS Kubernetes fork.


# Motivation
Weâ€™re hearing from users across a variety of organizations that need a longer window of stability.  For organizations with multiple teams or complex environments, staying on top of upgrades can pose a significant challenge. With three releases happening each year and a year of support for any given release, updates require frequent action. LTS will help teams plan and test upgrades on a longer timeline, while staying on a supported Kubernetes version.

# Roadmap
The following processes have been identified as priority areas of focus for Kubernetes LTS (may be subject to change)

- Patching process
- Backporting process
- Security process
- Release process
- Testing
